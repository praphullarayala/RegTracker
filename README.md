## Understanding Regulatory Mandates

### What is a mandate?

A mandate is a specific authority or assignment given to one of the European Supervisory Authorities to perform a designated task, such as reporting, providing guidance, or creating market standards.

### Legislative Process

The legislative process for RTS (Regulatory Technical Standards) and ITS (Implementing Technical Standards) consists of four phases:

1. The EBA publishes a consultation paper to gather market feedback
2. The EBA issues a final draft report
3. The European Commission either adopts it (with possible amendments) or rejects it
4. The adopted regulation is published in the Official Journal (OJ) of the European Union

Guidelines and reports are published by the EBA without having to follow all these stages.

### Status Indicators

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: On-time publications
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Delayed publications
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Overdue and unpublished documents
